# Exploring-Supermarket-Sales-Pattern-In-Ecuador
This project aims to identify the key drivers of supermarket sales in Ecuador and provide actionable insights through an interactive Tableau dashboard. The dashboard integrates data from sales transactions, store information, promotions, oil prices, and holiday events to offer users an intuitive view of sales patterns across stores and product categories. The motivation for this project stems from the need to enhance decision-making for supermarket stakeholders by uncovering sales trends and external influences such as promotions, seasonality, and economic factors like oil prices. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for optimizing inventory management, refining promotional strategies, and catering to diverse consumer preferences. The business significance of this project lies in its potential to enable supermarkets to strategically align resources, mitigate risks from fluctuating market conditions, and enhance profitability by responding proactively to consumer demand and external trends. By leveraging a data-driven approach, this project empowers stakeholders to adapt to market changes, improve operational efficiency, and maximize profitability.

The analysis reveals that the Food and Beverage sector dominates sales, with Grocery and Beverages having the highest demand. Within this segment, Grocery alone accounts for nearly 30% of total unit sales, highlighting its importance as a critical revenue driver. Promotions are particularly impactful for fresh items and household goods, driving significant sales uplift. For example, product categories like hardware and food & beverages saw a sales increase of over 80%, while promotions for media products negatively impacted sales, suggesting the need for careful targeting. Store Types A and D contribute significantly to sales, accounting for over 65% of total sales combined. These stores perform exceptionally well in urban clusters like Quito, which also ranks as the highest-selling city across all metrics. Sales peak in December and decline in October, with notable spikes during holidays and events. For instance, the 2016 earthquake led to increased demand for essential products like food and beverages, emphasizing the importance of agile inventory management during external disruptions. Additionally, the correlation tool reveals an inverse relationship between oil prices and sales volume, indicating that rising oil prices reduce purchasing power and transaction volumes.
